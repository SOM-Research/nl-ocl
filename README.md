# Combining OCL and Natural Language: a Call for a Community Effort
The growing popularity and availability of pretrained natural lan-
guage models opens the door to many interesting applications com-
bining natural language (NL) with software artefacts. A couple of
examples are the generation of code excerpts from NL instructions
or the verbalization of programs in NL to facilitate their compre-
hension.


Many of these language models have been trained with open
source software datasets and therefore “understand” a variety of
programming languages, but not OCL.


We argue that OCL needs to jump into the machine learning
bandwagon or it will risk losing its appeal as a constraint specifica-
tion language. For that, the key first task is to create together an
OCL corpus dataset amenable for natural language processing.
